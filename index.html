Besides Los Angeles, the school districts are Long Beach, Santa Ana, Fresno, Oakland, Sacramento, San Francisco and Sanger.

One key condition is that the school districts must evaluate teachers based on student academic growth, which typically means standardized test scores.

U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who announced the waiver in a telephone call with reporters, preferred to focus on other elements of the plan, notably that more students will be included in measuring the success of a school.

For example, under current state rules, the performance of black students, as a group, only is considered if there are more than 100 African American students at a school. (That number is 50 for small schools.) So those black students could be doing poorly and it wouldn't matter in terms of a school's rating. Now, the performance of these students will count if there are as few as 20 in a school.

This new rule also will apply to Latinos, low-income students, those learning English and disabled students. In all, the performance of 150,000 students in these groups will count for the first time.

	It&#39;s good to be exuberant and progressive, but you must strive to conquer a more childish (less child-like) part of your character.  Continued indulgence and lack of discipline now will jeopardize the natural good fortune you have been experiencing.  Be strict about your diet,  thoughts, feelings, and intentions.  You must gain control of the wayward child in you and dedicate yourself to a constructive program designed to encourage the person you wish to become.  Your improvement plan must be ambitious, but fluid enough to fit your changing circumstances.

<p align="justify">
	One of the best things about you is your natural ability to deal with the bizarre behavior of the people around you.  At times you seem to others to be the epitome of &#34;cool&#34;.  Nothing flusters you and you gain respect as you calmly take each new change in stride.  This is an attractive quality to those who need to merge karma with a stable figure like you.

DESPERATE TRICKS OF NATURE

Painted for war, 
Painted for mating, 
Shaking with desire, 
We are desperate tricks of nature.
</pre>

<div align="right"><a href="#top">Top</a></div>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	There is tremendous generative power in the month of March.  Life&#39;s unexpected answer to the dark and death of winter lies, all potentially, gathering its energy in deep earth.  Any false start can send vulnerable and premature shoots into a still-freezing world.  It is the same within the lives of men.  You have strength-the power to transform and evolve, but it must be released at the right time.  Don&#39;t be tempted out before the signs and conditions are favorable.  Your success is all but assured in spite of internal and external obstacles which subtly tity of my life?  Who is in control inside me?  This is an important crossroads and close examination of every detail of the time is the only way to bring about the positive conclusion you seek.  The omen here is good for those who develop willpower.  Without it, the misdirected strength you possess could cause upheaval and loss in your life.
</p>

<h3>Line 1</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	If you wrong-headedly advance into a situation for which you are not sufficiently prepared, you will only bring bad karma upon yourself.  Probably, you have been tempted, as a reaction to your own fear and insecurity.  It would be better to keep you accumulating energy beneath the surface now.  Look to the small things, knowing that later you will be rewarded for being conservative now.
</p>

<h3>Line 2</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	You feel the weather beginning to clear.  Unmistakable revelations reaffirm the coming of spring.  Now, more than ever, maintain your integrity.  Only the most undedicated spirit throws away its chance for peace.  Things are flowing and you are liquid and natural as water.  There is no need to force the time.
</p>

<h3>Line 3</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	This is a good time to relax consciously, especially in the area of desires.  The need for outward approval is natural to our race, but we needn&#39;t be slaves to our psychological inadequacies.  Avoid large and empty promises as they foolishly reveal weakness.  Achieve strength through individuality, as you make the wise decisions based on lasting principles.  This line indicates a need to be humble, as well as strong.
</p>

<h3>Line 4</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	You have the power of Spring inside you now.  Grasses, leaves, and flowers are simple indications of the more complex power which generates them.  Revel in your silence.  You will become stronger as you positively influence events and draw little attention to yourself.  Cultivate deep and passionate faith in yourself.
</p>

<h3>Line 5</h3>

<p align="justify"> The Package Tracking System
For developers that wish to keep up-to-date with other packages, the package tracking system allows them to subscribe (through email) to a service that will send them copies of BTS mails and notifications for uploads and installations concerning the packages subscribself.
</p>

<h3>Line 6</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	You must conquer stubbornness.  Usually the stubborn person is resistant because he fears that a temporary, healthy loss of self is potentially destructive.  This type of person&#39;s emotions come so chaotically that a hyper-rigid and super-defined stance is a natural response.  The problem is that holding back or reaching out done out of time will produce a serious talk with yourself about how to get what you want.
</p>

<hr width="50%">
 use of your will and a laid-back demeanor, made convincing by truthfulness and sincerity.  Get yourself in line and people will follow you and admire you.
</p>

<h3>Line 1</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	You are all set to move ahead, but there is an obstruction.  Someone doesn&#39;t trust you and you must be philosophical about it.  A quick negative reaction would only decrease your chances to get things under way.  Be open and giving, particularly to your critics and use generosity as your watch-word until a clearer picture of how to advance appears.
</p>

<h3>Line 2</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	There is sorrow in this line.  The obstruction preventing the forward motion with someone reaches a high point.  The stand-still produces sadness in you until unexpected good fortune occurs.  It is possible that this positive turn of events comes by chance, but more likely, it comes through your own passive gentleness in the situation.  On the mysterious side, assistance might come to you from a female, look for it, particularly from your own family.
</p>

<h3>Line 3</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	Things are moving in this line in spite f difficulties.  Your power is not strong enough to take on the world, but luckily, strong friends will help you hold on.  Developing your balance will aid you most and help keep you free of distracting attitudes.  This is a good time to think of goals and keep them in mind as you use communal determination to smooth the rough spots.
</p>

<h3>Line 4</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	You are in the right place at the wrong time.  Consequently, you might find the pace of your life accelerated.  The problem is that you are a more private and secretive person who will only fall into trouble as the world becomes more aware of your lifestyle.  Don&#39;t be tempted to do wrong in a time of quick and seemingly easy gain.  Watch the people around you as they watch you.

You are hiding in a temple,
Watchful wearing cool, gray shadows.

Knew you were there,
Listening like you were
Stealing cookies.

<h3>Line 5</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	Be relaxed when things around you start to get out of control.  You have built a reputation as an unusual person.  You are different, and consequently, people might give you more space at crucial times.  Look for a quiet way around and away from obstacles, and hold most of what you truly believe on the inside.  It will come naturally to you-like an actor.

<h3>Line 3</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	Take care not to deceive yourself.  Don&#39;t be lazy in a time which outwardly appears to be running smoothly.  Don&#39;t squander precious time which could be used to build your character.  People trust you and your will is molding your environment, but beware, lip service to a goal is not enough to make it happen, and if your easy time runs out, you will need to live on the fruits of the hours which are now passing.
</p>

<h3>Line 4</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	You are a &#34;star.&#34;  People look up to you and value your opinion because you understand the implications of timing.  You are doing everything right in the eyes of some people; among them you are &#34;first among equals.&#34;  Your honor is increased because they are good people and with their aid you can achieve good beyond your reckoning.
</p>

<h3>Line 5</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	Your goal is in view.  The tide of events runs with you and the realistic vision of your desire fulfilled haunts you.  Temptation tells you to increase speed and throw caution to the winds.  However, your path lies in the world of calm, patience, and attention to detail.  You can experience your dreams, if you remember that every oversight now will hold you back at a later and more intense time.
</p>

<h3>Line 6</h3>

<p align="justify"> 
	Your values are going to have to lead you now.  You are deeply involved in living day to day; so deeply into the present that your goals seem far distant and doubts creep into your mind.  Go on your deepest feelings and stay true to your principles; the mood of the world will change and you must be a stabilizing force in it.

Listen and observe, but the answer will come, in its own time, from deep inside you.
